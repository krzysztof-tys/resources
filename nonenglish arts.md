Summary: Interesting books, poems, music and other forms of arts.


## Notes
Poems by **Pablo Neruda** (**Chilean** poet and legend): Vent Poemas de amor y tuna canción desesperada (Twenty Love Poems and A Song of Despair)
El Coronel no tiene  quien le escriba - **Gabriel García Márquez**. First novel I studied when in school.

---

In **Filipino**, one of my favorite poets is **Benilda Santos** and her classic collection, Pali-Palitong Posporo (Each Matchstick is the loose translation) delights every generation that discovers it.

For poetry in English or translated in English:
**Adrienne Rich** (her book Fact of a Doorframe)
**William Stafford** (his book of poems The Darkness Around Us is Deep)
**Rumi** (collected poems)

For novels in English:
-Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury (forget the movie, the book is so much more chilling because so many things it wrote about as fiction have happened)
-Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera (it reads like nonfiction in the beginning (because it discusses philosophy and the idea of eternal return)
-Lavinia by Ursula K. Le Guin
